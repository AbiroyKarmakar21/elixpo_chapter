## Development Note

The website is being built in a private repository, but updates are being made in the open-source version to keep track of changes and ensure security. This project is part of Hacktoberfest, and we welcome contributions from open-source developers.

Additionally, Kaggle builds are being created for the dataset to be published, and a model is being developed under specific circumstances. A Discord bot is also in development for the same purpose, alongside a Minecraft mod utilizing the Fabric API of version 1.21 to process requests and generate images in-game.

Research papers will be published, and efforts to fine-tune stickers and improve code readability are underway to make the repository more user-friendly.

## Collaborators

We are excited to collaborate with various developers and artists in the open-source community. If you are interested in contributing, please reach out! Together, we aim to enhance the capabilities of this art generator.

## Funding

This project is currently funded through a combination of personal investments and community contributions. We are exploring sponsorship opportunities to further expand the project's development and outreach. If you would like to support us or discuss potential funding options, please contact us.


## Gallery

You can explore the generated artwork in our [Gallery](https://elixpoart.vercel.app/src/gallery). 

We can include a query parameter `id` to help share specific images by their image ID. For example, you can access an image directly using the following link:

[https://elixpoart.vercel.app/src/gallery?id=9pde71i621](https://elixpoart.vercel.app/src/gallery?id=9pde71i621)

### Kaggle and Data Science Builds

We are planning to enhance our presence on Kaggle by creating and sharing various data science writings and scripts. These builds will focus on optimizing the dataset for our AI models and providing insights into data processing techniques. Our goal is to foster a community around data science practices and encourage collaboration on Kaggle.
