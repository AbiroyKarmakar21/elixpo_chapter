# Programmable 8-bit Computer on Breadboards

![Computer](/path/to/computer_image.jpg)

This repository contains the code, schematics, and documentation for a programmable 8-bit computer built from scratch using simple logic gates on breadboards. The project is open source and fully scalable, capable of integrating additional functions and ICs.

## Project Overview

The computer is divided into several parts:

- PWM Clock
- Address Register
- RAM
- Instruction Register
- Control Logic
- Program Counter
- A Register
- B Register
- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Output Display
- Output Register
- Control Word
- Overflow, Underflow, Negative Flag Register

## Credits

This project is inspired by and credits Ben Eater for the original idea and guidance. While based on his concepts, this implementation includes updates and differences, enhancing functionality and scalability.

## Features

- **Scalability:** Easily expandable with additional functions and integrated circuits.
- **Custom Updates:** Includes enhancements and modifications beyond the original design.
- **Open Source:** Available for anyone to study, modify, and contribute to.
