### Welcome to Elixpo SOR, begun in 2023 as a college initiative, this open-source series has grown into a collaborative ecosystem of open source projects and collaborative development. In just two years, we've built over 17 projects, engaged a global community, and participated in numerous hackathons and open-source programs.
