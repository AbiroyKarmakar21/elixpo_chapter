when a user logins using the email and the otp/google/github then when a new registration is made in the db when we 
have to add the username in the bloom filter.

the registered email will be unique from the databse which will be done from the auth service of firebase 
but the username will be unqiue from the bloom filter -- 
if the user is there in the bloom filter or is hutting the false positive then the database will be checjed


if the user is nt thete in the bloom filter then the user is free to create the username in the process 
(process of choosing names only)
