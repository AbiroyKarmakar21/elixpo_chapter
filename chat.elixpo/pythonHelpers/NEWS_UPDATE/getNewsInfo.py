    # 2025 U.S. Open Leaderboard and News Update: J.J. Spaun Leads, Koepka and Rahm Chasing at Oakmont

## Tournament Overview

The 125th U.S. Open teed off at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania on Thursday, June 12, 2025. Oakmont, renowned for its punishing rough and fast greens, is hosting the championship for a record 10th time. The tournament runs through Sunday, June 15, with a field featuring top PGA Tour and LIV Golf players alongside regional qualifiers. The course is set up as a par 70, stretching to 7,372 yards, and is widely considered the toughest test in championship golf this year, with the winning score expected to be near even par due to the USGA's notoriously difficult setup. The rough, according to defending champion Bryson DeChambeau, is "cooked beyond belief" and a major factor in this week‚Äôs challenge [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2025/06/09/us-open-2025-time-tv-odds-live-stream/84070189007/), [Today's Golfer](https://www.todays-golfer.com/news-and-events/majors/us-open/2025-preview/).

## Round 1 Highlights and Leaderboard

### J.J. Spaun Sets the Early Pace

- **Leader**: J.J. Spaun surged to a 4-under-par 66, finishing Day 1 as the solo leader and the only player to go significantly below par on the demanding Oakmont layout. Spaun‚Äôs round stood out as many big names struggled to handle the course‚Äôs difficulties.
- **Chasers**: Brooks Koepka, representing LIV Golf, emerged as the top scorer from that circuit, outperforming his teammates Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm and placing himself well within striking distance after Round 1 [Sports Illustrated](https://www.si.com/golf/us-open).
- **Challenging Conditions**: The Day 1 scoring average was over four shots above par, highlighting just how tough Oakmont is playing. Even brief periods when the course seemed "gettable" saw few players able to take advantage.
- **Notable Performances**:
    - **Brooks Koepka**: Best round among LIV contingent, quietly positioning himself among the contenders.
    - **Jon Rahm**: Remains in the hunt, but not in the top echelon after the first round.
    - **Rory McIlroy**: Endured a difficult start, reminding fans of the relentless challenge Oakmont presents.
    - **James Nicholas**: The 28-year-old Korn Ferry Tour member found himself inside the top 10, marking one of the better performances among lesser-known competitors.
- **Historic Shots**: Patrick Reed made only the fourth recorded albatross (2 on a par-5) in U.S. Open history. Shane Lowry also notched a shot never seen before at a U.S. Open at Oakmont, adding to Day 1‚Äôs drama [Sports Illustrated](https://www.si.com/golf/us-open).

### Scoring Expectations

- Experts and players alike suggest that even par could be good enough to win this championship, given Thursday‚Äôs carnage and the USGA‚Äôs reputation for making the weekend even tougher [Today's Golfer](https://www.todays-golfer.com/news-and-events/majors/us-open/2025-preview/).

Spaun leading after a sizzling 66. Top stars like Brooks Koepka and Jon Rahm are within touching distance, while previous favorites such as Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have ground to make up.
