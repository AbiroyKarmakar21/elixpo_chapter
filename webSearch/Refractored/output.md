## Video Summary: "How to Encrypt and Decrypt Text Using the Vigenère Cipher"

The video explains the Vigenère cipher, a classical encryption technique for text. Here’s a breakdown of the process:

1. **Choosing a Keyword:**
   For example, given the plaintext "we love math", you pick a keyword such as "mouse". Repeat this keyword above the plaintext to match its length.

2. **Tabula Recta Table:**
   Encryption uses a special square table called the "tabula recta", where both the row and column headers list the alphabet. Each row shifts the alphabet one letter left from the row above.

3. **Encrypting the Text:**
   Pair each letter in the plaintext with the corresponding repeated keyword letter. For each pair:
   - Find the keyword letter on the table's row header.
   - Find the plaintext letter on the column header.
   - The cipher letter is at the intersection of that row and column.
   This process is repeated for all letter pairs to form the cryptic text.

4. **Decrypting the Text:**
   Decryption also uses the keyword. Write it repeatedly above the ciphertext. For each pair:
   - Use the keyword letter to choose a row in the tabula recta.
   - Find the ciphertext letter in that row.
   - The plaintext letter is obtained by seeing what column it’s under.
   Repeat for all pairs to restore the original message.[YouTube Transcript]
