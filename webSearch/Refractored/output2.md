### 2. Summary of the "Banker's Algorithm in Operating System" ([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/))

The **Banker's Algorithm** is a crucial resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems.

#### Purpose:
- It ensures the system always stays in a “safe state,” meaning it allocates resources to processes in such a way that deadlocks are avoided.    

#### How It Works:
- The algorithm is compared to a banker deciding whether to grant a loan: only if, after granting the loan (resources), the bank (system) can still meet all its obligations (process needs) can the allocation proceed.
- It keeps track of the resources that each program might need, allocates them carefully, and ensures the system can satisfy all possible requests even after every allocation.

#### Main Components:
- **Available:** 1D array indicating how many instances of each resource are available.
- **Max:** 2D array specifying the maximum demand each process can have.
- **Allocation:** 2D array specifying what each process currently holds.
- **Need:** 2D array showing remaining resources each process requires (`Need = Max - Allocation`).

#### Why the Name?
- Named after the banking analogy, where a bank only approves loans if it never risks being unable to serve all its customers' maximum potential withdrawal requests.

In essence, the Banker's Algorithm allows operating systems to safely and efficiently manage resources by predicting the future needs of all processes and preventing deadlocks before they happen.

### 3. What’s the Current Time in the USA?

The United States spans multiple time zones. As of the provided current UTC time (**2025-05-15 19:15:23 UTC**), here are the corresponding local times in the main U.S. time zones (assuming daylight saving is in effect for May):

| Time Zone        | Offset   | Local Time            |
|------------------|----------|-----------------------|
| Eastern (EDT)    | UTC-4    | 15:15 (3:15 PM)       |
| Central (CDT)    | UTC-5    | 14:15 (2:15 PM)       |
| Mountain (MDT)   | UTC-6    | 13:15 (1:15 PM)       |
| Pacific (PDT)    | UTC-7    | 12:15 (12:15 PM)      |

> The USA covers several time zones. As of the time mentioned above, you can calculate the local time by subtracting the appropriate number of hours from UTC for your zone.
> (Reference: Native knowledge on US time zones)

If you need the current time for a specific U.S. city or state, please specify the location!
