## 🎯 Problems Solved

### Issue 1: Content Overlapping When Scrolling
**Before**: Project showcase had `position: absolute` with negative top value
**After**: Proper relative positioning with margin-based spacing

### Issue 2: Unprofessional Tilt
**Before**: `rotateX(20deg)` made the image look amateurish
**After**: Subtle `rotateY(0deg) rotateX(0deg)` with hover interactions

### Issue 3: Stats/Partners Hiding
**Before**: Fixed positioning caused elements to be covered
**After**: Proper z-index layering and spacing system

### Issue 4: Mobile Responsiveness
**Before**: Broken layout on smaller screens
**After**: Complete responsive system with 4 breakpoints
