**Privacy Policy for Elixpo Art: Select Text and Transform to Picture**  

**Effective Date:** [11-03-2025]  

Elixpo Art: Select Text and Transform to Picture ("the Extension") is an open-source project licensed under the MIT License. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how the Extension operates.  

### **1. Information We Collect**  
Elixpo Art does not collect, store, or share any personal information. The Extension works entirely within your browser and does not track user activity.  

### **2. How the Extension Works**  
- The Extension allows users to select text on a webpage and generate AI-powered images.  
- The selected text is sent to an external API (`txtelixpo.vercel.app` and `imgelixpo.vercel.app`) for text enhancement and image generation.  
- The generated image is displayed locally within the Extension and can be downloaded by the user.  

### **3. Third-Party Services**  
The Extension makes requests to the following services to generate enhanced text and images:  
- `txtelixpo.vercel.app` for refining input prompts.  
- `imgelixpo.vercel.app` for generating AI-powered images.  

These services may process the provided text and image generation request, but the Extension does not collect or store any data from users.  

### **4. Permissions and Data Access**  
- The Extension requires access to all webpages (`<all_urls>`) to function correctly, as it enables users to select text from any site.  
- The Extension does not track or log any browsing history.  
- No personal data, cookies, or user-specific identifiers are collected.  

### **5. Security**  
We do not collect or store any user data, minimizing security risks. However, we encourage users to review the privacy policies of `txtelixpo.vercel.app` and `imgelixpo.vercel.app` when using the Extension.  

### **6. Your Choices**  
Since the Extension does not collect personal data, there are no settings required for data privacy. If you do not wish to use the text-to-image feature, you can simply disable or remove the Extension from your browser.  

### **7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**  
We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in functionality or regulations. Any updates will be reflected in the Extension repository.  

### **8. Contact Information**  
For any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please reach out via the official GitHub repository or support channels.
