Hello Samarendra Das, 

I hope you are doing well.

This is to kindly request the speaker and microphone setup from the Cultural Room for the upcoming Hacktoberfest Meetup â€“ Kolkata, scheduled to be held on October 27th, 2025 at JIS University (Room No. 1109).

We would need the setup for the entire duration of the event, i.e., from 9:40 AM to 4:30 PM, to ensure smooth conduction of the sessions and speaker interactions.

We promise to return the requested item, at the earliest following the completion of the event.

A kind request from my side on behalf of GDG Core Team 2025 is to please check the battery life of the microphone prior to the event, which would be highly crucial due to the heavy usage of the same. 

Your support in facilitating this arrangement would be greatly appreciated, as it will help us deliver a seamless experience for both the audience and the guest speakers.

Thank you so much for your time and assistance.

Warm regards,
Ayushman Bhattacharya
GDG JISU Organizer
