Dear Senior(s),

I hope you’re all doing great!

It gives me immense pleasure to invite you to join us for the Hacktoberfest Meetup – Kolkata, partnered by GDG JISU, on October 27th, 2025, at JIS University (Room No. 1109).

Event Details:

Date: October 27, 2025

Expected Arrival: 10:00 AM

Venue: Room No. 1109, JIS University

Your presence means a lot to us — not just as our seniors, but as a vital part of GDG JISU’s journey from its previous season. We have something special planned, and it would be incomplete without all of you there. (We’ll keep the surprise under wraps for now!)

The day will be filled with exciting sessions, guest talks, and open-source showcases — a true celebration of the community you helped build and nurture.

Looking forward to seeing you all back with us and reliving some of those amazing GDG moments together!

Warm regards,
Ayushman Bhattacharya
GDG JISU Organizer
