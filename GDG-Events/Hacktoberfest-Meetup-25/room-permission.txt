Respected Dr. Sandip Roy Sir, 

I hope you are doing well.

On behalf of GDG JISU, I would like to request permission to use Room 1109 on October 27th, 2025, from 9:40 AM to 4:30 PM, for our upcoming event — Hacktoberfest Meetup – Kolkata.

We are expecting an audience of around 200 students and delegates, including external speakers, throughout the day. Room 1109 has been identified as an ideal venue due to its spacious seating capacity, proper lighting, and built-in projector setup, all of which will help us ensure a smooth and engaging experience for attendees.

We sincerely request your approval to utilize the room for the event. Your support would greatly help us in successfully hosting this meetup and encouraging student participation in open-source initiatives.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
Ayushman Bhattacharya
GDG JISU Organizer
