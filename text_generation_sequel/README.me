# Elixpo.ai Text Generation

This repository contains the source code for the Elixpo.ai Text Generation API, a powerful and flexible service for generating text using various language models.

## Features

- Support for multiple language models (OpenAI, Mistral, Llama, Claude)
- GET and POST request handling
- JSON mode for structured output
- Seed support for reproducible results
- Temperature control for output randomness
- System prompt support
- Request caching for improved performance
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Circuit-Overtime/elixpo_ai_chapter.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd elixpo_ai_chapter
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables (API keys, etc.) in a `.env` file.

4. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```


## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. By default, each IP address is limited to 20 requests per minute. Cached responses do not count towards this limit.

## Caching

Responses are cached to improve performance and reduce unnecessary API calls. The cache is persisted to disk and loaded on server start.
