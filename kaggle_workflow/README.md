## Text Classification

### Logistic Regression Classifier

The first section implements a logistic regression classifier to differentiate between meaningful and gibberish text.

- **Libraries Used**: `pandas`, `sklearn`, `pickle`
- **Data Loading**: Combined dataset is loaded, consisting of two columns: `response` and `label`.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is split into features (X) and labels (y), followed by a train-test split.
- **Vectorization**: TF-IDF vectorization is applied to the text data.
- **Model Training**: A logistic regression model is trained on the vectorized training data.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on the test set, and the accuracy is printed.
- **Model Saving**: The trained model and vectorizer are saved using pickle.

### Keras Model for Text Classification

This section uses a Keras Sequential model for classifying text.

- **Libraries Used**: `numpy`, `tensorflow.keras`, `sklearn`
- **Data Preparation**: The dataset is prepared, and sequences are tokenized and padded.
- **Model Definition**: A Keras model is defined with several dense layers and dropout for regularization.
- **Model Compilation**: The model is compiled with Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
- **Training**: The model is trained for a specified number of epochs.
- **Evaluation**: The model's predictions are evaluated using accuracy score and classification report.

### Evaluation and Prediction

In this part, new texts are classified using the trained Keras model.

- **Input Texts**: Example texts are defined for prediction.
- **Tokenization and Padding**: The new texts are tokenized and padded to match the model's input shape.
- **Predictions**: The model predicts whether the texts are meaningful or gibberish.

### Model Saving

The Keras model and tokenizer are saved for future use.

- **Keras Model**: Saved in HDF5 format.
- **Tokenizer**: Saved using pickle for loading later.

## Text Generation

This section utilizes the T5 model for generating text based on a descriptive prompt.

- **Libraries Used**: `transformers`
- **Model Loading**: The pre-trained T5 model and tokenizer are loaded.
- **Input Prompt**: A specific input prompt is defined to guide the generation process.
- **Text Generation**: The model generates text using sampling parameters like `top_k`, `top_p`, and `temperature`.
- **Output**: The generated text is decoded and printed.

## Conclusion

This notebook demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for text classification and generation using various models and techniques. It provides practical insights into loading data, preprocessing text, training machine learning models, and generating creative outputs. The techniques covered can be further extended or modified for more advanced applications in natural language processing.
